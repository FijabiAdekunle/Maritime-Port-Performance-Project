[![Port-banner.png](https://i.postimg.cc/j5sXKLw2/Port-banner.png)](https://postimg.cc/sBNS4fJC)

This project provides data exploration and visualization of port performance statistics using a Streamlit dashboard, based on the UNCTAD dataset for 2022 and 2023.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores trends in vessel size, age, port time, and cargo capacity using historical data across different vessel types and time periods. Visualizations and summaries help stakeholders assess maritime port performance and identify potential efficiency gaps.

## 🗂️ Dataset

- Source: UNCTADstat
- Scope: Port call and vessel performance stats (2022–2023)
- Columns include vessel type, period, average vessel age, port time, gross tonnage, cargo and container capacity.

📁 **Available Data**:
- `cleaned_port_performance_dataset_2022_2023.csv` — final cleaned dataset used in dashboard and analysis.

## 🧪 EDA Highlights

- **Vessel Age**: Most vessels range between 6–36 years.
- **Port Time**: Container and LNG ships have the shortest turnaround time.
- **Correlations**: Strong link between vessel size (GT) and cargo/container capacity.
- **Period Trends**: Stable metrics across 2022 and 2023 with slight seasonal effects.
